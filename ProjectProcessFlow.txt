Steps to follow:

1. Create git repo and clone it on the local machine.
2. Create file "Code.py" by writing relevant code to it.
3. Ensure to perform git add/commit/push before initilising DVC.
4. Do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc). ## Ensure to perform pip install dvc, if you never worked on dvc previously.
5. Do "mkdir S3" (creates S3 directory). ## Temp Directory on Local Machine.
6. Do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" ### Syntax to let dvc know the location of the data directory, which could be Local or Cloud. This will set 'myremote' as a default remote.
7. Next "dvc add data/", followed by-  ## Evertime save data in data/ folder for versioning
    a. "git rm -r --cached 'data'"
    b. "git commit -m "stop tracking data"
    As initially, we were tracking data/ folder  from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle
8. Rerun "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) followed by "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Next perform, "dvc commit" followed by "dvc push"
10. Perform "git add/commit/push " mark this stage as a First Version(V1) of Data.
11. Make changes to "Code.py" in order to add new row in data, and check changes by "dvc status"
12. Again perform "dvc commit" followed by "dvc push"
13. Save version two(V2) of data by performing "git add/commit/push"
14. Ensure everything is upto date by checking dvc/git status
15. Repeat steps 11 to 13 for the next versions (V3, V4 and so on)
