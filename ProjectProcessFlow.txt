Steps to follow:

1. Create git repo and clone it on the local machine.
2. Create file "Code.py" by writing relevant code to it.
3. Ensure to perform git add/commit/push before initilising DVC.
4. Do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc).
5. Do "mkdir S3" (creates S3 directory).
6. Do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/", followed by-
    a. "git rm -r --cached 'data'"
    b. "git commit -m "stop tracking data"
    As initially, we were tracking data/ folder  from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle
8. Perform "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) followed by "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Next perform, "dvc commit" followed by "dvc push"
10. Perform "git add/commit/push " mark this stage as a First Version(V1) of Data.
11. Make changes to "Code.py" in order to add new row in data, and check changes by "dvc status"
12. Again perform "dvc commit" followed by "dvc push"
13. Save version two(V2) of data by performing "git add/commit/push"
14. Ensure everything is upto date by checking dvc/git status
15. Repeat steps 11 to 13 for the next versions (V3, V4 and so on)
